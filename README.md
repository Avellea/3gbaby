# 3GBaby


[enso_ex](https://github.com/SKGleba/enso_ex) module for enabling the 3G USB port inside of a PCH-1000 (and 2000, but why?)

Theoretically this can be used for a manual installation of a PSVSD, though hardware testing must be done.
The repo will be updated with the test results of that project eventually.
